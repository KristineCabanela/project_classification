### About the Project

## Project Goals

My goal is to identify key drivers of churn, which customers at risk of churn, and make recommendations for changes so that we can reduce the churn rate for month to month customers and reduce customer attrition.

## Project Description

Customers of Telco are leaving the company.  With these lost customers, the company is losing revenue.  We will analyze the attributes of customers who were more or less likely to churn, develop a model for predicting churn based on those attributes, and leave with recommendations to prevent current and future customers from leaving the company.


### Initial Questions

Which demographic of individuals are churning? Are these customers senior citizens or non-senior citizens?

Do the customers that are churning have dependents or no dependents?

What type of payment type are customers using that are churning at a higher rate?

What type of payment type are customers using that are less likely to churn?

## Steps to Reproduce

- Create an env.py file that contains the hostname, username and password of the mySQL database that contains the titanic_db.passengers table. Store that env file locally in the repository.
- Clone my repo (including an acquire.py and prepare.py) (confirm .gitignore is hiding your env.py file)
- Libraries used are pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn.
- Document conclusions, takeaways, and next steps in the Final Report Notebook.
